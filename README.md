here we designed a valid grammar for FORTRAN  language that was refactoring to be 
free from (left recursion and left factoring ) then implemented to handle FORTRAN syntax  





## Key Features


 ### ✅ Program supports animation :
 providing an animation for the DFA for 
every token with the same order of the syntax 

### ✅ Program implements panic mode : 
when error detected in your syntax code 
the program will proceed checking to other token and wont stop until the end of 
the syntax

### ✅Program can identify type of error :
by detecting errors in syntax the 
parser can figure the correct tokens and show what should to be done 

### ✅Program can identify the line where the error occurred :
by getting errors 
the compiler can handle the line number of the syntax errors 

### ✅Program can generate DFA :
by using Pyvis library we made a large-scale 
diagram that contains all possible tokens for this language
